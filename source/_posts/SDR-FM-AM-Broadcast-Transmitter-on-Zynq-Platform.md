Recently I have made this radio broadcast transmitter with my little knowledge in DSP.
The audio quality is awesome (😅) compared to my previous FPGA AM radio transmitter.

# Basic Principles

{% asset_img architecture.png Architecture %}

The architecture is shown in the diagram above. Basically, the DAC generates the low-frequency modulation signal, and the ADF4351 generates the high-frequency carrier signal. Two signals are then mixed together through the mixer to form the final signal. The principle behind it is that multiplication in the time domain will cause a shift in the frequency domain. In other words, the signal generated by the DAC is shifted to a higher frequency by the signal generated by ADF4351.

# Things I learned

The frequency spectrum is symmetrical, like shown in the following picture. The left line is the negative one, and the right is the positive one.
