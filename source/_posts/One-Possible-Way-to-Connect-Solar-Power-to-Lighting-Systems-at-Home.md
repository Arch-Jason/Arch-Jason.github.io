I have a small solar panel power system at home. However, the power was not utilized util I found this way to connect it to the lighting power at home. I tried it and it worked. Here are the steps:

## 1. Connect the DC source to an AC inverter

This is the simplest part. Basically you buy a 12V DC to 220V AC inverter and connect it to the 12V DC source, then you'll get a 220 power output.

## 2. Find and connect the neutral wire

In most housings, the neutral wires of all appliances are connected together, as well as the neutral wires for the lighting system. So you find a power outlet (the easiest way to do this, I think), and connect the neutral wire of it to one of the two wires of the inverter to create the "equal electric potential".

## 3. Find and connect the live wire for lighting system

In most of the cases, the lighting system's live wires are separate from the live wires of other appliances, so the key is to connect it with the live wire from the inverter while keeping the power input from the grid off. To do this, you need to **switch off the separate switch of the grid input for lighting systems**. Then, you connect inverter's live wire to lighting system's live wires. I found the easiest way to do this is to use the live wire inside one light's switch.
