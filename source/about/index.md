Hi there! I'm a high school student in Beijing. Currently, I'm studying at the Experimental High School attached to the Beijing Normal University. My hobbies include DIY things, Coding, Photography, Railway Traveling, Hiking, and so on. I also like playing the B-flat trumpet and the F horn. Feel free to contact me if you share the same hobbies with me!
